## UI Prototype

## Code Coverage

## Code Style Guide

To maintain code quality and ensure consistency throughout our codebase, we have adopted specific style guides for our backend and frontend code. Contributors are expected to follow these style guidelines when submitting code to the project.

### Backend (Python)

For our backend code, we follow the [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/) conventions, specifically version `2.11.1`. This tool checks your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.

To install pycodestyle, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pycodestyle==2.11.1
```

Before submitting a pull request, please check your code for style violations by running:

```bash
pycodestyle your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the path to the file you want to check. Address any style warnings/errors before submitting your code.

### Frontend (Next.js)

For the frontend, we use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and enforce code styles and conventions using ESLint and Prettier. Ensure you have the latest versions of both installed.
